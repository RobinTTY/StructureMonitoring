 ﻿# Description
  
  This program has two main purposes:
  
  - The Event-Hub Client is a background application, which gets data from the Iot-Hub every second
  
  - The Azure-Storage table functions return telemetry data of last day, last week and last month from the 
    Azure database

  Both modules can be obtained by the front-end with a get request.
